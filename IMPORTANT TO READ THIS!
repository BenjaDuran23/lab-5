Hello, i had to update some things in my application because i was having some strange errors like the initial javascript configurations and something with css while i was working in this laboratory. I hope this changes don't affect the correction proccess 
On wednesday i talked to the person in the laboratory and he told me to use chatgpt to solve this problem because he didn't know how to solve it in that moment
